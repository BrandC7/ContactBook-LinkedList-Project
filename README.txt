This is a project for my Object-Oriented Programming class in Python.
It creates a dynamic Address Book with the help of a linked list.
Some debugging was done with the help of AI Codeium.

There are some possible improvements to the code based on several use cases.
For example:
	When trying to delete a person using the last name but there are two persons with the same last name the code will delete the first entry it iterates through.
	After going through the deleting an entry function, if we try to run the add entry function it will not add it.

The team collaborated to complete the assignment but each of us took a different approach to setting up the code.
